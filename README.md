# Here the code for INCLUSIVE project



- Nextjs 14 (using page folder). By force this means also we use React 18 with a functional approach with hooks.

- A CSS in JS approach to style: styled-component v5

- TypeScript 4 to write functions and components (it work like a soft documentation for the code)

- Prettier to format the code

- Git and github to keep track of the code
  
- For documentation: the vast majority of the code is not commented and is written in JavaScript, not a single test is in the code

- The code is ready to fetch but the actual backend connection should be done to make adjustments
