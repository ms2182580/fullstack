- Nextjs 14 (using page folder). By force this means also we use React 18 with a functional approach with hooks.

- A CSS in JS approach to style: styled-component v5

- TypeScript 4 to write functions and components (it work like a soft documentation for the code)

- Git and github to keep track of the code
  
- For documentation: the vast majority of the code is not commented and is written in JavaScript, not a single test is in the code

- The code is ready to fetch but the actual backend connection should be done to make adjustments


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>## Formating
 
 - Prettier to format the code
 - We use 2 spaces to indent the code
 - We don't use the final semi colon on javascript or typescript files
 - We remove the unused imports on save
 - And we format the code on save


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>## Git commits

 - In the commit use a prefix to other developer understand what is about the commit, with `Added`, `Changed`, `Removed` and `Fixed`. Examples:
   1.  `Added` - `<feature>` in `<some_place>`
   2.  `Changed` - `<feature>` in `<some_place>`
   3.  `Removed` - `<feature>` in `<some_place>`
   4.  `Fixed` - `<what_was_solved>`
